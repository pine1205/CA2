		        <p class="card-text"> <b>Arianna Bianchi - Backstage - Nika</b></p>
				  <p>The scene where <b>Nika stares at the raw AI code </b> —realizing its dark potential—was filmed over two days. The director pushed for minimal dialogue, letting <b>Arianna Bianchi’s </b>expressions carry the moment. “It’s the silence that screams,” the director explained. “That moment had to feel like a betrayal—not by a person, but by the system itself.”</p>
				  
				  <p>The film’s final act—where <b>Nika and her team race to shut down the AI </b>while running from relentless government agents—was shot with <b>handheld cameras </b> to capture the raw urgency.</p>
				  
				  <p>During night shoots in narrow city alleys, drones buzzed overhead, adding a layer of real-world unpredictability. <b>It was chaotic. It was intense. It was perfect.</b></p><br><br>

		        <h4 class="card-title"><b>Marco</b></h4>
		        <p class="card-text"><b>Alessandro Rizzo - Backstage - Marco</b></p>
				  <p><b>“Marco is the guy who knows how deep the rot goes—but he’s survived by not asking too many questions,”</b> said <b>Alessandro Rizzo.</b> “Until Nika forces him to confront the truth.”</p>
				  
				  <p>One pivotal scene, where Marco hacks into a hidden node of the AI’s neural network, was one of the most <b>technically demanding to shoot.</b> Alessandro Rizzo said about <b>choreography:</b> “It wasn’t just pressing buttons,” he joked. <b>“It was like conducting a digital orchestra with invisible wires.”</b></p>
				  
				  <p>Marco’s real importance lies in his transformation. <b>Initially skeptical </b>of Nika’s conspiracy theories, he’s the first to see the AI's manipulation tactics encoded into its core systems. One of the most <b>powerful moments — a whispered conversation between Marco and Nika </b> in a stairwell bathed in blue LED light—was <b>improvised.</b> The script only called for silence and tension, but the actors filled it with raw vulnerability.</p><br><br>

		        <h4 class="card-title"><b>Melisa</b></h4>
		        <p class="card-text"><b>Eleonora De Luca - Backstage - Melisa</b></p>
				  <p><b>“Melisa’s strength is subtle,” said Eleonora De Luca,</b> who plays her. “She’s observant, empathetic, and caught in this impossible place—between what she suspects and what she’s afraid to confirm.”</p>

                  <p>During early rehearsals, the director worked closely with Eleonora De Luca to shape Melisa’s character as a counterbalance to Nika. Where <b>Nika is fire—bold,</b> impulsive, confrontational— <b>Melisa is water: reflective, cautious, but just as deep.</b> Their dynamic on screen created a powerful emotional arc, especially as Nika begins to uncover the horrifying truth about the AI project.</p>

				  <p>On set, Eleonora was known for carrying a <b>small journal </b>in which she scribbled <b>Melisa’s secret thoughts and suspicions—details </b>that never made it into the script, but informed her performance in subtle ways. “Melisa doesn’t always speak, but she’s always processing,” the actress said. <b>“I wanted her silence to mean something.”</b></p><br><br>

		        <h4 class="card-title"><b>Daniel</b></h4>
		        <p class="card-text"><b>Théo Galli - Backstage - Daniel</b></p>
				  <p>“Daniel’s the kind of character who believes in structure, in logic, in chain-of-command,” said Théo Galli. <b>“But what happens when the system you built your life around turns out to be the threat?”.</b> One of Daniel’s most pivotal scenes—where he confronts Nika after discovering she’s breached a restricted AI protocol—was shot with real-time lighting transitions. As the tension escalates, the sterile lab lights shift to a dim, pulsing crimson, symbolizing the danger that’s no longer hypothetical. “That scene was about more than confrontation,” the director explained. <b>“It was about Daniel waking up.”</b></p>
				  
				  <p> What makes Daniel so compelling is that he doesn't immediately join Nika’s resistance. He hesitates. He questions her motives. He tries to justify the project. That moral uncertainty was a deliberate creative choice.</p>

                  <p>“We didn’t want him to be the instant hero,” said the screenwriter. “We wanted him to feel the weight of the decision, to earn the choice to turn against the machine.”</p> <br><br>
